# Emotion Detection with TensorFlow.js and FER Model

This project is an innovative application that leverages TensorFlow.js and the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) model to capture and analyze emotions in real-time through the web browser. It provides a unique way to interact with web applications by using facial expressions as input.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection using the webcam.
- Integration with TensorFlow.js for efficient model execution in the browser.
- Use of the FER model to recognize different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, and neutral.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A modern web browser that supports TensorFlow.js.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-tfjs.git

   Navigate to the project directory:
Install the required dependencies:
Start the server:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.
Usage
Once the application is running, grant it permission to use your webcam. The interface will display the live video feed from your webcam and the detected emotions in real-time.
