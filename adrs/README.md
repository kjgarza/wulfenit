Creating a system like Wulfenit, which combines real-time emotion detection from video feeds with dynamic image generation, involves a variety of technical and design challenges. As a software architect, outlining Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) is crucial for documenting the decisions made during the system's development. ADRs help in understanding why certain choices were made, provide a historical context for future team members, and ensure consistency in decision-making. Here's a list of potential ADRs for the Wulfenit system:


### 1. Choice of Emotion Detection Algorithm
- **Decision to be made:** Selecting the most suitable algorithm for real-time emotion detection from video feeds.
- **Considerations:** Accuracy, performance, resource usage, and the ability to integrate with the existing system architecture.

### 2. Framework for Machine Learning Model
- **Decision to be made:** Choosing a framework for developing, training, and deploying the machine learning model for emotion detection.
- **Considerations:** Support for real-time processing, scalability, community support, and compatibility with various deployment environments.

### 3. Image Generation Technique
- **Decision to be made:** Deciding on the method or technology for generating images based on the detected emotions.
- **Considerations:** Quality of generated images, generation speed, resource requirements, and the ability to produce diverse images reflecting a wide range of emotions.

### 4. Data Privacy and Compliance
- **Decision to be made:** Ensuring the system complies with data privacy laws and regulations, particularly concerning the handling of video feeds and any biometric data.
- **Considerations:** GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection frameworks, data anonymization techniques, and user consent mechanisms.

### 5. System Architecture and Components
- **Decision to be made:** Determining the overall system architecture and the main components required for emotion detection and image generation.
- **Considerations:** Modularity, scalability, maintainability, and the choice between microservices vs. monolithic architecture.

### 6. Video Processing Infrastructure
- **Decision to be made:** Selecting the infrastructure for processing video feeds in real-time.
- **Considerations:** On-premises vs. cloud-based solutions, scalability, cost, and support for real-time data streaming technologies.

### 7. Handling Unsupported Emotions
- **Decision to be made:** How to handle emotions that the system cannot accurately detect or for which it cannot generate images.
- **Considerations:** User feedback mechanisms, system responses, and potential for system learning or adaptation.

### 8. User Interaction with Generated Images
- **Decision to be made:** Designing the interface and interaction model for users to view, select, and interact with generated images.
- **Considerations:** Usability, accessibility, response times, and integration with other systems or platforms for sharing or saving images.

### 9. Deployment Strategy
- **Decision to be made:** Planning the deployment strategy for the system, including considerations for updates, scalability, and fault tolerance.
- **Considerations:** Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, containerization, orchestration tools, and cloud vs. on-premises deployment.

### 10. Monitoring and Performance Evaluation
- **Decision to be made:** Implementing a system for monitoring the performance of the emotion detection and image generation components, as well as overall system health.
- **Considerations:** Metrics to be collected, monitoring tools, alerting systems, and performance benchmarks.

Each ADR should be documented in detail, providing a clear explanation of the problem, the options considered, the decision made, and the rationale behind it. This ensures transparency and aids in future decision-making processes.
