# Choice of Emotion Detection Algorithm

## Context and Problem Statement

- **Decision to be made:** Selecting the most suitable algorithm for real-time emotion detection from video feeds.
- **Considerations:** Accuracy, performance, resource usage, and the ability to integrate with the existing system architecture.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Can be implemented in python
* It should work with a webcam
* Should run locally in a docker container
* It should be able to detect a a least seven emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Contempt and Surprise.

## Considered Options

* OpenCV. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq_01gFG2vk
  * https://python.plainenglish.io/real-time-emotion-detection-from-webcam-using-deep-learning-and-opencv-952953dbf051
* [{title of option 2}](https://github.com/ElenaRyumina/EMO-AffectNetModel)
* [{title of option 3}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0H6vojQhE8)
* [How MorphCast Emotion AI HTML5 SDK works]{https://www.morphcast.com/}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->

### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR is confirmed. E.g., by a review or an ArchUnit test.
 Although we classify this element as optional, it is included in most ADRs.}

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {title of option 1}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
<!-- use "neutral" if the given argument weights neither for good nor bad -->
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {title of other option}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
